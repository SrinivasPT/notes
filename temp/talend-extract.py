# What Good Looks Like for the Customer Risk Rating Project (Revised)

## Overview
This document outlines the qualitative characteristics of successful outcomes for the Customer Risk Rating project, which refactored a Java-based batch process to process 11 million records in 20 minutes, down from 24 hours for 200,000 records. The project avoided a PySpark migration by implementing optimizations like Spring Batch, SQL Server enhancements, JDBC, database partitions, and graph-based logic, with ChatGPT aiding technical exploration.

## Qualitative Indicators of Success
1. **Exceptional Performance Optimization**:
   - Reduced processing time from 24 hours for 200,000 records to 20 minutes for 11 million records, enabling near-real-time delivery.
   - Optimized Java solution outperforms potential PySpark migration, recognized for efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

2. **Impactful Technical Enhancements**:
   - Optimizations (e.g., Spring Batch Partitions, SQL-based processing, conditional indexes, JDBC Template, database partitions) reduce processing times and resource usage.
   - Graph-based logic accurately identifies customer groups, praised for innovation.

3. **Reliability and Operational Resilience**:
   - Consistent data integrity across high volumes, validated by quality checks.
   - Rerunnable publish process and Kafka-based logging ensure minimal downtime and rapid issue resolution.

4. **Scalability and Strategic Alignment**:
   - Database and Spring Batch Partitions support future data growth with minimal rework.
   - Java optimization leverages existing infrastructure, aligning with organizational capabilities.

5. **Business Value and Stakeholder Satisfaction**:
   - Faster risk ratings improve decision-making, earning positive feedback from risk management teams.
   - Real-time Kafka publishing enhances downstream system efficiency.

6. **Innovation and Team Empowerment**:
   - ChatGPT exploration enables cutting-edge optimizations, empowering the team.
   - Refactored Java solution serves as a model for data-intensive projects.

7. **Transparent Communication and Collaboration**:
   - Clear logging and documentation reduce miscommunications.
   - Effective demos and reports align stakeholders, reinforcing project value.

## Conclusion
Successful outcomes are characterized by exceptional performance, innovative Java-based optimizations, and significant business impact. The projectâ€™s reliability, scalability, and strategic alignment, supported by tools like ChatGPT, position it as a benchmark for high-volume data processing.
