Once the issue has been identified and resolved, the payout will be added to your next [scheduled payout](https:\/\/support.wix.com\/en\/article\/scheduled-payouts-in-wix-payments). \n  \n  Payouts are placed on hold if:\n  You have a failed payout.\n  You have an unresolved [verification issue] (https:\/\/support.wix.com\/en\/article\/wix-payments-verification-process).\n  \n  Please click on the payout in your Wix Payments dashboard to see the reason for the payout failure and for instructions on how to resolve it.\n  \n  If it is a failed payout:\n  There are many reasons why a payout may fail, such as incorrect bank account details, or even your bank changing ownership. To help avoid payout failures, we recommend you follow the 2 troubleshooting steps below:\n  \n  Step 1 | Verify the bank details associated with your Wix Payments account:\n  Make sure that you've registered your bank account details correctly: The bank account holder's name must match the name of the Wix Payments account owner.\n  For example, if you've registered to Wix Payments under Lisa Harrison but the associated bank account is listed as \"\"Lisa's Cupcakes\"\", the transfer will fail.\n  \n  1.

If necessary, correct it and click Save. \n  \n  \n  Step 2 | Verify that your bank account can receive EFT payments:\n  Wix Payments sends payouts to your bank account as EFT payments (Electronic Funds Transfer). If you're located in the US, the payouts are sent as ACH transfers. If you have a failed payout, you should verify with your bank that your account can receive such a transfer.\n  If your account cannot receive EFT payments, update your settings to a different bank account that can receive them. Make sure that the account details match, as described in step 1 above.\n  \n  As soon as your payment details are updated, and your new account details have been verified, the funds will be included in your next scheduled payout.","article_ids":["9dbf43e1a13c691c4ac016af067a723ca51613c639d878f7c556dd1a1fbc3018","04997ca3b0a1736557e6895e2eecc51ccd581a1982afa647b5ebf835e68d4deb"]}

{"question":"Im troubleshooting why my automated email isnt being sent after a form submission. Ive confirmed that Ive checked the automation statistics.","answer":"If your automation is triggering but the automated email isn't sent, follow these steps:\n\nStep 1 | Check the spam folder\nWhen you set up an automation to send an email to your contact, the email could end up in their spam folder. They (or you, if you're testing the automation) should go to their inbox and look for the email in that folder as well. Learn more about automations sent through Wix Email Marketing being marked as spam.\n\nIf checking the spam folder doesn't solve the issue, please whitelist the following emails:\n- no-reply@test.wixshoutout.com\n- If you have not set a confirmed reply-to email: @automations.ascendbywix.com\n- If you have set a confirmed reply-to email: Your email address.\n\nStep 2 | Check that the recipient's email address is active\nCheck that the recipient's email address is active and that they've subscribed to your mailing list. If they have, you'll see a \"SUBSCRIBED\" label on their contact card. If your automation sends an email to an inactive contact, the email will not go through.\n\nStep 3 | Check that the recipient's email address is valid\nCheck that the recipient\u2019s email address is valid. If it's not, the recipient won't receive an email (even if the automation was set up correctly).\n\nStep 4 |  Check that the correct trigger app is set: Ensure that your trigger app is set to Wix Forms, not Site Members or any other app.\n  \nStep 5 | Verify the correct form is selected: If you've set a specific form to trigger your automation (rather than any form), make sure you've selected the right form.\n  \nStep 6 |  Ensure there is an email\/phone field in your form: If your automation's trigger is \"Form submitted,\" it relies on specific contact details to complete the action. If these contact details are missing, the action cannot be completed.\n  \nStep 7 |  Check that the email field is the correct form field type: Access the form in your Editor to manage its fields. Hover over your email field to ensure its title is \"Email Field.\"\n  \nStep 8 |  Verify that the email field is synced with an email field in your Contact List: The email field in your form needs to be synced with your Contact List. The synced field must be either \"Email\" or \"Email (Main).\" If it\u2019s anything else, it won't work as an email field. Without this sync, a contact is not created, and an automated email cannot be sent.\n  \nStep 9 |  Check if you hold multiple email addresses for one contact: Access the contact's contact card to see if you have multiple email addresses for them. If a contact has multiple email addresses, automated emails are usually sent to an additional email rather than the contact's main\/primary email. Contacts with only one email address are not affected.","article_ids":["91eeefd48d7dcfda197a6162b7259e942579b5e6a53f50def1b09fecaad9ee1d"]}

Since many of your subscribers likely use Gmail, it\u2019s important to understand what their filter looks for when flagging spam.\nHere are some of the factors Gmail uses to decide if emails are legitimate:\nIf the sender's email address or domain name has been blacklisted before.\nSuspicious phrases and words (i.e. \"how to make money online fast\").\nSpelling mistakes and bad grammar.\nCorrupted or misconfigured email headers.\nSuspicious email attachments (Google recommends sharing files as links using cloud storage services).\n\nIf you know your audience and only send content to subscribers, you'll likely avoid spam complaints.

{"question":"My old website pages are still showing on Google despite updating the SEO. I have already tried removing the old URLs and submitting the updated sitemap to Google, but the issue persists.","answer":"Search engines crawl and index content from every page that you publish, with the exception of pages that you prevented search engines from indexing, pages that are password protected. Just as it takes search engines time to crawl and index a new website, it also takes time for them to recognize that a website or old URLs have changed or are no longer available. This can happen if you deleted a page, image, or file from your site, or if you edited the URL of one of your pages. The process of removing pages and files from search results and how long it takes depends entirely on the individual search engines. This also applies to images appearing in Google Images search results.\n\nThere are a few steps you can take to address this issue:\n\n1. **Use Google's URL Removal Tool**: You can request Google to remove outdated URLs using the [URL removal tool](https:\/\/support.google.com\/webmasters\/answer\/9689846?hl=en). Ensure your site is verified with Google Search Console to use this tool.\n\n2. **Check for Redirects**: Ensure that any old URLs are properly redirected to the new URLs using 301 redirects. This can help maintain SEO rankings and guide users to the correct pages. You can set up redirects using the [Wix URL Redirect Manager](https:\/\/support.wix.com\/en\/article\/setting-up-a-301-redirect-for-a-page-on-your-site).\n\n3. **Request Indexing**: After making changes, request Google to recrawl your site by using the [URL Inspection Tool](https:\/\/support.google.com\/webmasters\/answer\/9012289) in Google Search Console.\n\n4. **Check for 'noindex' Tags**: Ensure that your new pages do not have 'noindex' tags, which would prevent them from appearing in search results.","article_ids":["7a2a95eef86788654dd78c208baa0f8adc5ba65cdf05d27b90ebf747d87ca171","24953d9f24a1cd711d55a2a3729dd74257e6de98ea882b8a9ae49e2d2720d1fa","568140964e5e7c1628d295e9991367ed4d3c2090a79105d435231030b620a506"]}

{"question":"My site is unable to provide a secure connection.","answer":"The Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) is a security measure used by websites and browsers for communicating over the internet. A site which has an SSL certificate is secure, meaning that any data exchanged between you and the site is encrypted. A website that implements SSL has \u201cHTTPS\u201d in its URL instead of \u201cHTTP\u201d.\nIf you're having issues viewing your site over a secure HTTPS connection, follow the steps below to troubleshoot your SSL certificate.\nStep 1 | Make sure your DNS records are correct\nFor your SSL certificate to be enabled, your domain needs to be connected to your site. \nReview your domain's connection method below to check you have the correct DNS records and ensure that your domain is properly connected. \nIf your domain is connected via name servers:\nMake sure your domain host has the following name servers set for your domain:\n\nTo connect your domain to Wix, setup your name servers as follows:\n\nns2.wixdns.net  (216.239.36.100)\nns3.wixdns.net  (216.239.38.100)\n* Please only add the IP addresses if required by your domain host.\n\nNote: Contact your domain host if you need help configuring your name servers.\n\nMake sure you have the default A and CNAME records in your Wix account:\n[Go to Domains] (https:\/\/premium.wix.com\/wix\/api\/mpContainerStaticController#\/domains) in your Wix account.\nClick the More Actions icon  next to the relevant domain.\nSelect Manage DNS Records.\nCheck the records under the A (Host) and CNAME (Aliases) sections.\n\nIf your domain is connected via pointing:\nMake sure your domain host has the following DNS records for your domain:\nA record: \nHost name: @ (or empty)\nValue: 185.230.63.107\nCNAME:\nHost name: www (or www.yourdomain.com)\nValue: pointing.wixdns.net\nNote: Contact your domain host if you need help configuring your DNS records.\n\nIf you purchased your domain from Wix:\nMake sure you have the default A and CNAME records in your Wix account:\n[Go to Domains] (https:\/\/premium.wix.com\/wix\/api\/mpContainerStaticController#\/domains) in your Wix account.\nClick the More Actions icon  next to the relevant domain.\nSelect Manage DNS Records.\nCheck the records under the A (Host) and CNAME (Aliases) sections.\n\nStep 2 | Wait until your domain has propagated\nIf you recently updated your DNS records, wait up to 48 hours to allow your domain to complete propagation. Domain propagation is the process of updating the global chain of DNS servers around the world with the changes you made, ensuring that your site is up to date whenever anyone accesses it. \n\nStep 3 | Ensure that DNSSEC is not signed\nIf you purchased your domain outside of Wix, check with your domain host to make sure that DNSSEC is not signed for your domain as it can interrupt the propagation process.\nIf you purchased your domain from Wix, disregard this step as all Wix domains have DNSSEC automatically not signed.\n\nStep 4 | Ensure only HTTPS code is entered in the HTML element\nIf you have an [HTML element] (https:\/\/support.wix.com\/en\/article\/wix-editor-embedding-a-site-or-a-widget) on your site that contains HTTP in the code (instead of HTTPS), you may see a message in your browser indicating your site is not fully secure.\nMake sure the code you enter contains HTTPS (and not HTTP). If you've added code with http:\/\/ in it, remove it or replace it with https:\/\/ code. \nGoogle notification showing an unsecure web address,\nTo replace the code in an HTML element:\nIn your Editor, navigate to the page you've added the HTML element. \nClick the HTML element.\nClick Edit Code.\nUnder Add your code here (HTTPS only): make sure the code does not contain http:\/\/ in it.  \nClick Publish at the top right of your Editor.\nNote: If you have multiple HTML elements, repeat the steps to make sure each is using HTTPS code only. \n\nImportant:\nOlder operating systems can sometimes [fail to recognise a modern SSL Certificate] (https:\/\/support.wix.com\/en\/article\/ssl-certificate-not-showing-on-devices-running-older-windows-or-mac-operating-systems).\nThis does not mean there is an issue with your site's SSL Certificate. To resolve the issue, update your device to the most recent operating system (OS) available from Apple or Windows.

{"question":"My website does not appear in search engine results. I need help with indexing and optimizing my site's SEO to ensure it gets listed.","answer":"When you publish your site, most of your pages are available for search engines like Google to crawl and index so that they can appear in search results. It can take some time for your page to appear. \nHowever, search engines cannot guarantee that every page of your site will be indexed. It's important to note that this is perfectly normal in many cases. \n\nTo check if your site was indexed by search engines, search \"site:\" followed by your site's domain with no spaces. For example: site:wix.com\n  If any of your domain's pages are listed in the search results, those pages have been indexed. If there are no results for your domain, your website has not been indexed yet. \n\nStep 1 Check that you have allowed search engines to crawl and index your site.\n\nTo enable search engines to index your site:\n1. [Go to your SEO dashboard.] (https:\/\/manage.wix.com\/my-account\/site-selector\/?siteType=HtmlWeb&actionUrl=https:\/\/www.wix.com\/dashboard\/{{metaSiteId}}\/seo-home?referralInfo=KB-f3388913-140f-47a9-b2ba-4bf86b60e04e&title=Select%20a%20Site&buttonText=Go+to+SEO)\n2. Select Go to SEO Settings under Tools and settings.\n3. Make sure the Let search engines index your site toggle is enabled.\n\nStep 2 Check if your pages has any redirects\nWix's URL Redirect Manager lets you create 301 redirects for pages on your site. 301 redirects tell web browsers that the URL of a page on your site has changed permanently to a new URL. It also tells browsers that visitors who try to access the page's old URL should be sent to the new URL instead.\n\nIf your page has a 301 redirect and the page doesn't appear in search results, try deleting the redirect.\n\n1. [Go to your SEO Dashboard.] (https:\/\/manage.wix.com\/my-account\/site-selector\/?siteType=HtmlWeb&actionUrl=https:\/\/www.wix.com\/dashboard\/{{metaSiteId}}\/seo-home?referralInfo=KB-f3388913-140f-47a9-b2ba-4bf86b60e04e&title=Select%20a%20Site&buttonText=Go+to+SEO)\n2. Select Go to URL Redirect Manager under Tools and settings.\n3. Hover over the 301 redirect that you want to delete.\n4. Click the Delete icon \n\nStep 3 We recommend using the Wix [SEO Setup Checklist] (https:\/\/support.wix.com\/en\/article\/improving-your-online-presence-with-the-wix-seo-setup-checklist) to optimize your site's SEO and submit your site to Google for indexing. The SEO Setup Checklist helps you pick the best keywords, title tags, and meta descriptions to rank higher. It also helps you connect your site to Google Search Console.\nAfter you've completed the SEO Setup Checklist, your site is submitted directly to Google for indexing.\n\nStep 4 Sitemaps give information to search engines like which pages are on your site and when they were last updated. Every Wix site has a sitemap that updates automatically with your site\u2019s most current information. Learn more about your site's sitemap file\nWhen you complete the steps in your Wix SEO Setup Checklist, Wix automatically submits your sitemap index to Google for you. When you make changes to your site, your sitemap will be automatically updated with the changes. There's no need to submit your sitemap to Google again. \nIf you want to submit your sitemap yourself, or submit it to other search engines, you can submit your sitemap directly. \n\n1. Go to [Google Search Console.] (https:\/\/search.google.com\/search-console)\n2. Select your site from the drop-down.\n3. Select Sitemaps.\n4. Enter the URL slug of the sitemap you want to submit under Add a new sitemap.\nFor example, to submit the sitemap for your entire site, enter sitemap.xml. \n5. Click Submit.\n\nStep 5 If your site is indexed, but not showing as high as you like in search results, [optimizing your site's content for SEO] (https:\/\/support.wix.com\/en\/article\/optimizing-your-sites-content-for-seo) can help your site rank higher. Similar to the SEO Setup Checklist, optimizing your site's content  helps search engines find and understand your site.\nA more technical but powerful way to improve your site's ranking is to use structured data markup. This is a standardized format for giving search engines detailed information about your page. \nAdding markup to your site's pages can help improve your website's search results and ranking. Search engines like Google can also use markup to [create rich results] (https:\/\/developers.google.com\/search\/docs\/advanced\/structured-data\/search-gallery) like article previews, product previews, and FAQs for your page's search results.

Ensure that the A and CNAME records match those required by Wix.\n\n2. **Flush DNS Cache**: Clear your browser's cache and flush your DNS cache on your computer. For Windows, open Command Prompt as an administrator and type `ipconfig \/flushdns`.\n\n3. **Verify Domain Status**: Ensure your domain is active and not expired. You can check this on [whois.com](https:\/\/www.whois.com\/).\n\n4. **Check Domain Assignment**: Make sure your domain is correctly assigned to your Wix site.

{"question":"I created a website using the Wix Editor, but it\u2019s not responsive.","answer":"Wix sites built in the Wix Editor are becoming more and more responsive as we continue to add more new and exciting full-width elements which expand to fill the entire width of the screen.\nWe recommend using full-width elements on your site. If you are using elements such as text boxes and images that can\u2019t be stretched to full width, make sure to keep them within the vertical grid lines so that your elements appear correctly on most screen sizes. [Click here](https:\/\/support.wix.com\/en\/article\/wix-editor-working-with-the-editor-gridlines) to learn more.\n\nThe following elements are full-width and responsive:\nStrips and columns\nFull-width slideshows\nGalleries\nHorizontal menus and lines\nGoogle Maps and other Wix apps\n\nNotes:\nSince non-responsive elements (such as images, text and shapes) do not adjust based on screen width, placing these elements on top of a responsive element, such as a strip, may cause differences in the way your page looks in different browsers or on different devices. \n\nCheck out Wix Studio:\nIf you are an agency or enterprise, you can build responsive sites using the Studio Editor in Wix Studio. This flexible, end-to-end solution includes smart design capabilities and flexible dev tools that let you deliver exceptional results for clients in any industry.

{"question":"How does the pricing for Google Ads work?","answer":"You can check the available budgets while setting up your campaign. Google Ads by Wix is paid through a monthly subscription or purchasing credits with a one time payment. When you set your campaign budget (daily spend on ads) you can see how much the monthly subscription amounts to. Wix gets 15% of your payment for running and optimizing your campaign, the remaining 85% goes towards your ad budget which is spent on ad clicks.\n  \nYour ad credit may include your monthly subscription, any rollover ad credit from previous months, as well as any qualifying Google Ads credit applied to your account. If you pay in a supported currency (e.g. EUR, GBP, JPY, USD) the ad credits are in the same currency. For all other currencies, ad credits in your dashboard show as USD. It is possible to continue running an ad with existing ad credit, even if your Google Ads with Wix subscription has expired.\n\nWe recommend a monthly budget that is about 5% of your monthly business revenue. However, you can start as low as $150 USD a month.","article_ids":["7e10270b7ecd05d2573050a9ca7541e71edcb7b2b82220e5079404417d10d7dd"]}
